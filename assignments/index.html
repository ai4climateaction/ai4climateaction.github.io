		<h3>Reflections</h3>

		<p>Each week during the forked lessons, you will submit one paper reflection based on one of that week's required readings. A good reflection goes beyond summarizing the paper—it should focus on your own critical analysis. See the rubric below for detailed expectations.</p>

		<p>If you are looking for guidance on how to read and engage with research papers, the following resources may be helpful:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/nse/2025/06/12/how-to-read-journal-articles/">How to Read Journal Articles</a> (MIT CommLab)</li>

        <h3 id="final-proj">Course Project</h3>

		<p>The final project in this course will be to develop a proposal for a new AI-based research project for a climate application (we are very open to broad interpretations of both what "AI-based" and "climate application" entail). The proposal should concretely describe your idea and additionally include some initial validation that this proposed idea makes sense (e.g., targeted literature review; concrete discussion of data, proposed methods, and evaluation; and preliminary experiments). Think of this like a grant proposal to a funding agency, where you do not yet need to have completed the idea, but want to put forward a convincing case that the idea makes sense and should be "funded" to proceed. We would like to see proposals that are clearly motivated by the climate/biodiversity need, as well as clearly grounded in the existing AI and climate/biodiversity literature. We take the stance that novelty can take many forms, and are excited to see your proposed versions of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17381">"Application-driven innovation"</a>.</p>

		<p>The components of the project will be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A preliminary presentation of the project at the end of the forked section of the course (to be presented in class April 13&ndash;22)</li>
			<li>A project proposal document due at the end of the course (May 11 by EOD)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You can work solo or in a group of up to 2. We will ask you to declare your groups by March 6.</p>

		<hr>

		<h4>Preliminary Presentation</h4>

		<p>The preliminary presentation will be an initial opportunity to share your project in progress with the class, and get feedback ahead of the final project proposal. The preliminary presentation will be graded on a Complete/Incomplete basis (full points if you do the presentation), and largely serves as an opportunity to receive feedback on the project direction, relevant related work, and ideas for methods and applications. It should be 15&ndash;20 minutes and include the following sections:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Introduction</b>
				<ul><li>Motivate the problem that your research project aims to solve</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Related Work</b>
				<ul><li>Clearly outline the past work that relates to the proposed research and characterizes gaps that the method will hopefully fill</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Datasets</b>
				<ul><li>Outline any potential sources of data that you are considering to include in the proposal, any pros and cons, or any existing data gaps</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Method and Experiment Design</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Describe your proposed research project methodology, including if and how you will build on prior work</li>
					<li>Describe any preliminary experiments/data analysis, or at minimum a plan for what experiments and analyses you will include in the final proposal (including what metrics you will measure)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Broader Impacts</b>
				<ul><li>Include a brief discussion of the pathway to impact for the project (what it would take to deploy, who the user/stakeholder community would be, any additional resources needed for translation)</li></ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>

		<h4>Final Project Proposal</h4>

		<p>The final project proposal should be <b>6&ndash;8 pages</b> long and include the following sections:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Introduction</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Motivate the problem that your research project aims to solve</li>
					<li>Include at least one "hero" figure that captures the project goals at a high level</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Related Work</b>
				<ul><li>Clearly outline the past work that relates to the proposed research and characterizes gaps that the method will hopefully fill</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Datasets</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Clearly define the data that you will work with for this project. If working from existing public datasets, justify why they are reasonably representative for the task or propose extensions/adaptations of those datasets. You can also propose the collection of new data here.</li>
					<li>If you will be proposing relabeling of additional data or collection of new data, we would like to see an estimate of the cost and time associated</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Method and Experiment Design</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Describe your research project methodology and design at least one figure that captures the method</li>
					<li>Describe if and how you will build on prior work</li>
					<li>Propose how you will test your method, what ablations you plan to do, and what metrics you will measure, as well as possibly including mockup figures of the trends you expect to see. Be concrete.</li>
					<li>Share the results of preliminary experiments aimed at validating the proposed approach. (We are open to broad interpretations of what "experiment" means depending on the context of your particular problem, data, and method.) Experiments may aim to, e.g., (a) show initial success on a smaller or "toy" version of the problem, or (b) identify the key risks or challenges in the proposed method, and justify that the proposed approach has the potential to overcome these key risks or challenges.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Broader Impacts</b>
				<ul><li>Finish by describing the potential impact the proposal could have on your application area, and describe what additional steps would need to be taken to translate the research to a user community</li></ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
