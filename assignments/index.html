		<h3>Reflections</h3>

		<p>Each week during the forked lessons, you will submit one paper reflection based on one of that week's required readings. Reflections are graded on a complete/incomplete basis and should be up to one page in length.</p>

		<p>A good reflection goes beyond summarizing the paper. Begin with a short summary (1-2 sentences) to orient the reader, then focus the majority of your reflection on your own critical analysis. In particular, your reflection should address:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How the paper frames the context and motivates the underlying problem</li>
			<li>The methodology proposed and whether it is well-suited to the problem</li>
			<li>What you find convincing and what you are less persuaded by, and what you might have done differently</li>
			<li>Possible extensions of the work — think beyond "apply a newer ML method" and reflect on the underlying problem itself</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Presentations</h3>

		<p>Each group will have 15 minutes to present, with up to 25 minutes total allocated per group to allow time for questions and discussion. Your presentation should cover five components: a summary of the application and its broader context, a summary of the method, a critique, proposed extensions, and discussion questions for the class.</p>

		<h4>Rubric (100 points)</h4>

		<p><b>Summary of application and its broader context (25 points)</b></p>
		<p>Present a mature framing of the "gap" within the problem domain, including a connection to the climate impact of filling that gap. Frame the "methodological gap" and how it connects to the problem gap. Establish common ground for your audience — introduce key technical terms and concepts clearly. Think about what you did not understand when you first started reading, and remember that your audience is your peers.</p>

		<p><b>Summary of the method (25 points)</b></p>
		<p>Describe the method accurately and in sufficient detail. Contextualize it within prior literature: spell out the differences from what was done before and explain what is significant about the proposed approach.</p>

		<p><b>Critique (25 points)</b></p>
		<p>Provide an in-depth analysis of what was done well and what was done poorly, considering the perspectives of problem motivation, problem framing, methods development, and evaluation.</p>

		<p><b>Extensions (10 points)</b></p>
		<p>Propose 1-2 extensions that are not trivial (e.g., simply swapping in a new architecture). Extensions should reflect a holistic, nuanced view of the problem and method — for example, new problem owners, new methodological directions, or new application contexts.</p>

		<p><b>Food for thought / questions for discussion (15 points)</b></p>
		<p>Prepare 3 discussion questions for the class that provoke thoughtful conversation about the paper and its broader implications.</p>
