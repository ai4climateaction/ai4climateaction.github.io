    <h2>Assignments and Evaluation Criteria</h2>

	<div class="col-md-12">
		<h3>Reflections</h3>

		<p>Each week during the forked lessons, you will submit one paper reflection based on one of that week's required readings. Reflections are graded on a complete/incomplete basis and should be up to one page in length.</p>

		<p>A good reflection goes beyond summarizing the paper. Begin with a short summary (1-2 sentences) to orient the reader, then focus the majority of your reflection on your own critical analysis. In particular, your reflection should address:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How the paper frames the context and motivates the underlying problem</li>
			<li>The methodology proposed and whether it is well-suited to the problem</li>
			<li>What you find convincing and what you are less persuaded by, and what you might have done differently</li>
			<li>Possible extensions of the work — think beyond "apply a newer ML method" and reflect on the underlying problem itself</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you are looking for guidance on how to read and engage with research papers, the following resources may be helpful:</p>

		<h3>Presentations</h3>

		<p>Each group will have 15 minutes to present, with up to 25 minutes total allocated per group to allow time for questions and discussion. Your presentation should cover five components: a summary of the application and its broader context, a summary of the method, a critique, proposed extensions, and discussion questions for the class.</p>

		<hr>
		<p><b>Rubric (100 points total)</b></p>

		<p><b>Summary of the application and its broader context (25 points)</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mature framing of the problem gap within the domain, including a clear connection to the climate impact of filling that gap</li>
			<li>Mature framing of the methodological gap and an explanation of how it connects to the problem gap</li>
			<li>Clear communication that establishes common ground for peers, including introduction of key technical terms and concepts (e.g., what was unclear when you first encountered this work)</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Summary of the method (25 points)</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Method is described accurately and in sufficient detail</li>
			<li>Method is contextualized within prior literature (e.g., how it differs from existing approaches and what is novel or significant about it)</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Critique (25 points)</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>In-depth analysis of aspects that were done poorly, considering: problem motivation, problem framing, methods development, and evaluation</li>
			<li>In-depth analysis of aspects that were done well using the same perspectives</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Extensions (10 points)</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Proposal of one to two non-trivial extensions that demonstrate a holistic and nuanced understanding of the problem and method</li>
			<li>Extensions should go beyond simple modifications such as swapping in a new architecture and may include new problem owners, new methodological directions, new application contexts</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Food for thought / questions for discussion (15 points)</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Three thoughtful discussion questions for the class</li>
		</ul>

        <h3 id="final-proj">Course Project</h3>

		<p>More details coming soon.</p>

		<!-- <p>The final project in this course is to propose a new AI-based research project for a climate application. We are very open to broad interpretations of both of these. You can work in groups of up to 3. We would like to see proposals that are clearly motivated by the climate need, as well as clearly grounded in the existing AI literature. We take the stance that novelty can take many forms, and are excited to see your proposed versions of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17381">"Application-driven innovation"</a>.</p>

		<p>Proposals should be <b>6-8 pages</b> long and include the following sections:</p>

		<p><b>Introduction.</b> Motivate the problem that your research project aims to solve. Include at least one "hero" figure that captures the project goals at a high level.</p>

		<p><b>Related Work.</b> Clearly outline the past work that relates to the proposed research and characterize gaps that the method will hopefully fill.</p>

		<p><b>Datasets.</b> Clearly define the data that you will work with for this project. If working from existing public datasets, justify why they are reasonably representative for the task or propose extensions/adaptations of those datasets. You may also propose the collection of new data. If you will be proposing relabeling of additional data or collection of new data, we would like to see an estimate of the cost associated.</p>

		<p><b>Method and Experiment Design.</b> Describe your research project methodology and design at least one figure that captures the method. Describe if and how you will build on prior work. Propose how you will test your method, what ablations you plan to do, and possibly include mockup figures of the trends you expect to see. Be concrete.</p>

		<p><b>Broader Impacts.</b> Describe the potential impact the proposal could have on your application area, and describe what additional steps would need to be taken to translate the research to a user community.</p> -->
